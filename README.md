## Introduction
BeaconOS is a Linux kernel-based operating system focused on providing a unified AI model training and inference runtime environment for edge devices and servers. Its open-source architecture and flexible design allow users to customize and extend it to fit their needs. As a brand new operating system, BeaconOS offers an efficient, secure, and stable runtime while providing many advanced features and tools, including an optimized kernel, multi-task manager, file explorer, and various common applications. Whether for daily use or professional development, BeaconOS is able to provide users with an efficient, enjoyable experience and excellent performance.

BeaconOS greatly reduces the threshold for deploying machine learning algorithms. Users only need to browse the rich preset algorithms through the [Algorithm App Store](https://store.edgevision.asia) and download the required algorithm apps with one click. Without development, algorithms can be applied to actual business through simple and flexible graphical interface configuration to achieve rapid iteration. The Algorithm App Store provides high-quality algorithms such as image recognition, speech recognition, anomaly detection and more for various industries, empowering AI.

## Core Features
1. Compatible with X86 & ARM architectures CPUs, can be deployed on x86 chip-based servers and ARM architecture-based edge devices  
2. Compatible with mainstream AI accelerator devices and chipsets, such as AI accelerator cards and chips from NVIDIA, Intel, Qualcomm, etc., providing hardware support for model deployment
3. Provides both local and cloud-based device management. Local management is suitable for edge computing scenarios, while cloud-based management can centrally manage large-scale devices
4. AI models can be deployed on-demand through a simple graphical interface without any development work required, covering full process from deployment to usage
5. Supports concurrent execution of multiple AI models, with different models able to concurrently leverage underlying compute resources  
6. Compute resource allocation across different AI models can be dynamically adjusted based on actual demand to achieve expected performance
