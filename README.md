## Core Features
1. Compatible with X86 & ARM architectures CPUs, can be deployed on x86 chip-based servers and ARM architecture-based edge devices  
2. Compatible with mainstream AI accelerator devices and chipsets, such as AI accelerator cards and chips from NVIDIA, Intel, Qualcomm, etc., providing hardware support for model deployment
3. Provides both local and cloud-based device management. Local management is suitable for edge computing scenarios, while cloud-based management can centrally manage large-scale devices
4. AI models can be deployed on-demand through a simple graphical interface without any development work required, covering full process from deployment to usage
5. Supports concurrent execution of multiple AI models, with different models able to concurrently leverage underlying compute resources  
6. Compute resource allocation across different AI models can be dynamically adjusted based on actual demand to achieve expected performance
